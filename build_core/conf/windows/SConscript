#Suppress specific warnings
# C4244 'conversion' conversion from one type to another type results in a possible
#       loss of data.  In AllJoyn code this occures most often when we convert a
#       socket file descriptor to an int.  It may be worth while to investigate
#       warnings of this type but for now we are going to suppress them.
# C4267 Conversion from size_t to another type.  We get this because we often change
#       size_t to another value when we iterate though arrays.  Although its possible
#       to cause issues we are going to suppress these warnings.
# C4345 warning specifying that the later versions of MSVC initialize POD types
#       (Plan Old Data) This warning is designed to inform users that the behavior
#       changed from older compilers.  This warning is only encountered by 
#       common/src/String.cc and does not effect AllJoyn.
#       see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wewb47ee.aspx
# C4355 "'this' used in base member initializer list"' Depending on the version of
#       the MSVC compiler this warning may or may not be shut off by default.
#       http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3c594ae3.aspx
# C4800 warning forcing value to 'true' or 'false'.  This warning is produced when
#       a value is changed from an int or a pointer to a bool. Usage of code that
#       does it is common in AllJoyn. We often check to see if a pointer is NULL
#       by checking if( ptr) This also is a common problem in the language bindings
#       with things like QCC_BOOL and jboolean being defined as integers. For this
#       reason we are choosing to suppress this particular warning.
# C4996 'strdup': The POSIX name for this item is deprecated. Instead, use the ISO
#       C++ conformant name: _strdup. See online help for details.
# C4351 "new behavior: elements of array 'array' will be default initialized"
#       This warning is triggered when we initialize the guid array in the GUID128()
#       constructor. We intentionally want to initialize this array, so this behavior
#       change warning can safely be disabled.
# C4146 "unary minus operator applied to unsigned type, result still unsigned"
#       The warning is triggered by the monty_rho() function in BigNum.cc when it
#       negates an unsigned value before truncating it to uint32_t. This is an
#       intentional part of the algorithm so the warning can be suppressed.
