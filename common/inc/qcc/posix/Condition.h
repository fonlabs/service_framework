/**
 * Declaration of a Mesa-Semantics condition variable.  This class provides the
 * mechanism used to implement the system aspects of a condition variable but
 * does not implement the variable itself.  It would be possible to implement a
 * templated virtual class to allow this to all be encapsulated into the the
 * condition variable, but in the interests of simplicity and flexibility, that
 * is left to the user of this class.
 *
 * The condition variable was invented to solve the bound buffer problem, and to
 * illustrate that use, the following code snippet shows how this class could be
 * used to address that type of problem using an STL deque as the protected
 * buffer.
 *
 * Since there are two conditions, buffer empty and buffer full, there are two
 * condition variables.  There is one Mutex protecting the shared buffer.
 * Notice that the Produce() function Wait()s on the full condition and
 * Signal()s the empty condition; while the Consume() function Wait()s on the
 * empty condition and Signal()s the full condition.
 *
 * @verbatim
 * std::deque<int32_t> prot;
 * const uint32_t B_MAX = 2;
 *
 * qcc:: Condition emtpy;
 * qcc:: Condition full;
 * qcc::Mutex m;
 *
 * void Produce(qcc::Condition& empty, qcc::Condition& full, qcc::Mutex& m, uint32_t thing)
 * {
 *     m.Lock();
 *     while (prot.size() == B_MAX) {
 *         full.Wait(m);
 *     }
 *     prot.push_back(thing);
 *     empty.Signal();
 *     m.Unlock();
 * }
 *
 * uint32_t Consume(qcc::Condition& empty, qcc::Condition& full, qcc::Mutex& m)
 * {
 *     m.Lock();
 *     while (prot.size() == 0) {
 *         empty.Wait(m);
 *     }
 *     uint32_t thing = prot.front();
 *     prot.pop_front();
 *     full.Signal();
 *     m.Unlock();
 *     return thing;
